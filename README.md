Python Apps and HADashboard for Home Assistant

Note: _This addon runs AppDaemon 3.x_

## About

AppDaemon is a loosely coupled, multithreaded, sandboxed python execution
environment for writing automation apps for Home Assistant home automation
software. It also provides a configurable dashboard (HADashboard) suitable
for wall mounted tablets.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "AppDaemon3" add-on.
1. Start the "AppDaemon3" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "AppDaemon3" add-on to see if everything went well.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "system_packages": [
    "ffmpeg"
  ],
  "python_packages": [
    "PyMySQL",
    "Pillow"
  ]
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

These log level also affects the log levels of the AppDaemon.

### Option: `system_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Alpine packages][alpine-packages] to be
installed to your AppDaemon setup (e.g., `g++`. `make`, `ffmpeg`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

### Option: `python_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Python packages][python-packages] to be
installed to your AppDaemon setup (e.g., `PyMySQL`. `Requests`, `Pillow`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

## AppDaemon and HADashboard configuration

This add-on does not configure the AppDaemon or HADashboard for you.
It does, however, create some sample files to get you started on the first run.

The configuration of the AppDaemon can be found in the `/config/appdaemon`
directory.

For more information about configuring AppDaemon, please refer to the
extensive documentation they offer:

<http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
